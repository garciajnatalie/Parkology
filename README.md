# Parkology
Parkology will be the open, online community to share ideas, tools, and resources for people who love quality parks within a 10-Minute Walk from home.

# Welcome!
Thank you for visiting <i><a href="www.parkology.org">Parkology</a>: An Open Online Community for People Who Love Parks</i>. This work is part of our participation in the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/">Mozilla Open Leaders, Round 5</a> initiative.

# What are we doing?
<b> The problem</b>
Barriers exist in the ability for people to advocate for local parks. These include lack of knowledge, limits to resources, and the inability to collaborate and share best practices with other park advocates in the community. Parks professionals already have their own communities, networks, and access to resources, though local grassroots members of the community do not have these resources currently. 

<b>The solution </b>
An open, online platform to strengthen communities facing disparities in a fair allocation of resources.

# Who are we?
Two of the proponents of Parkology who are focusing on its being an open platform are Natalie Garcia and Jeffrey Keefer. They are both advocates of these practices of working open: 
- Communicating simply
- Listening to participants
- Organizing community events
- Sharing leadership tasks
- Documenting our work and ideas

Natalie's appreciation for the environment and enthusiasm for creating fun and relevant content has led her to her current position as a Senior Web Content Editor at The Trust for Public Land, where she serves as the community manager for Parkology. In her spare time sheâ€™s chasing the marathon majors, indulging in good food, and exploring new places. 

Jeffrey is . . . Director of Training & Knowledge Management + Educational Researcher + Professor + Poet + Wikipedian = Liminality + Actor-Network Theory + Open Education 

# What do we need?
Our hope for Parkology is that all members of urban communities will be able to share ideas, tools, and resources to be empowered to promote access to a quality park within a 10-minute walk from their homes. We hope to attract local community members across the United States who are passionate about improving access to and quality of green spaces in their neighborhoods.
